# Project Overview

For this project, I used the technologies that I am most familiar with.

## Backend

- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

## Frontend

- **Formik/Yup**: Used for building and validating forms.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.

## Quick Start with Docker

Both the frontend and backend can be quickly initialized by Docker by following the instructions in the documentation.

## Development Approach

I started the challenge on the **Backend**, configuring the routes and controllers, and saw the need to create some auxiliary functions.

The **Frontend** began by making a "hard code" of the components and, upon completion, I componentized them to facilitate maintenance.

Upon finishing the project, I realized that I created many functions and routes in the Backend that were not all utilized, but they could be useful for new features in the future.
